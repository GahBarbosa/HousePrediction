# House Price Prediction - Machine Learning Project
## Project Overview
This project consists of developing a regression model capable of predicting house prices based on selected numerical features from the Ames Housing Dataset. The objective is to apply machine learning techniques, emphasizing data preprocessing, feature selection, model training, and evaluation.

## Dataset Description
- Dataset: Ames Housing Dataset
- Source: Kaggle - House Prices: Advanced Regression Techniques
- Target Variable: SalePrice

## Tools & Libraries
- Python 3.9+
- Pandas - Data manipulation and analysis
- NumPy - Numerical computing
- Matplotlib / Seaborn - Data visualization
- Scikit-learn - Machine learning models and evaluation
- Jupyter Notebook - Interactive development environment

## Machine Learning Pipeline
1. Data Loading & Exploration
- Load dataset into a Pandas DataFrame
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand feature distributions and correlations

2. Data Preprocessing
- Handling missing values
- Feature selection based on correlation and business understanding
- Feature scaling (if necessary)

3. Model Development
- Algorithm: Linear Regression (as baseline)
- Model fitting on the training set
- Hyperparameter tuning (if applicable in advanced models)

4. Model Evaluation
- Performance metrics:

5. Prediction
- Generate predictions on the test set
- Analyze residuals and error distribution

## Example of Model Metrics

> Note: Results may vary depending on dataset split and random state.

## How to Run the Project
```BASH 
git clone https://github.com/your-username/house-price-prediction.git
cd house-price-prediction
pip install -r requirements.txt
jupyter notebook HousePricePrediction.ipynb
```

## Future Improvements
- Hyperparameter optimization with GridSearchCV
- Deployment of the trained model via REST API (Flask/FastAPI)
